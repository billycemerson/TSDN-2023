## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a part of the **TSDN 2023 Competition**, where it became a finalist. The goal is to develop a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model** for detecting personal data in images. The dataset consists of:
- **Personal Data:** ID cards (KTP), Family Cards (KK), Driver's Licenses (SIM), etc.
- **Non-Personal Data:** Objects like food, animals, and human activities.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
This project consists of:

1. **Code**
   - **Data Collection:**
     - Gathering images containing personal and non-personal data.
   - **Preprocessing:**
     - Image augmentation to improve model generalization.
   - **Model Training & Evaluation:**
     - Using **CNN** for image classification.
     - Evaluating performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ðŸš€ Technologies & Frameworks
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, OpenCV, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Deep Learning** (TensorFlow, Keras, CNN)
- **Image Processing** (Augmentation techniques for dataset enhancement)
